# Getting started

These guides will help you create JW Lua scripts to use with Finale. More specifically, they'll help you create great scripts for the JW Lua Scripts repository. That way, you can build scripts faster, and help other Finale users find them.

These docs are a work in progress, but right now, you can still explore the function library as well as a few tips to help you get up and running.
