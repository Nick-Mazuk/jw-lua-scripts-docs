# Getting help

There are a few great resources for getting help with JW Lua development:

- [The JW Lua Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/742277119576336/)
- [Ask a question in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Nick-Mazuk/jw-lua-scripts/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help&template=help.md&title=)

If you're having trouble with JW Lua in particular, you should ask a question in the Facebook group first. If you're having trouble with contributing to this project, ask a question in the GitHub repository.
