# Getting help

There are a few great resources for getting help with Lua development:

- [The Finale Lua Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/742277119576336/)
- [Ask a question in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/finale-lua/jw-lua/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help&template=help.md&title=)

If you're having trouble with RGP Lua or JW Lua in particular, you should ask a question in the Facebook group first. If you're having trouble with contributing to this project, ask a question in the GitHub repository.
