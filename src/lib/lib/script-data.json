These mimic examples shown on p. 404 of “Behind Bars\"\nby Elaine Gould. For the best results with staccato dots, use an articulation with “Avoid Staff Lines” unchecked.\n\nBy default, the script searches for articulations using the '.' character (ASCII code 46) for non-SMuFL fonts and\nthe SMuFL dot character (UTF code 0xe4a2) for SMuFL fonts. This character must be the Main Character in Finale's\narticulation definition dialog. You can override this to search for a different character code using a\nconfiguration file. (See below.)\n\nTo use the script, you enter the notes you want to display, and it removes the noteheads in between the first\nand last notehead, adjusts any staccato dots, and adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes,\nunless there is one already there. If you want a slur as well, add it manually before or after running the script.\n\nThe steps to use this script are:\n\n1. Add the notes you want to display, with or without accidentals. Normally you choose notes with noteheads\nthat follow a straight-line path as closely as possible. They can be reduced size or grace notes.\n2. Add staccato dots if you want them.\n3. Add a slur if you want it.\n4. Run the script on the pattern you just entered.\n\nThe script takes the following actions:\n\n1. Searches for a selected pattern, skipping rests at the beginning and stopping at the first rest it encounters.\n2. Hides the noteheads on all but the first and (optionally) last entry.\n3. Hides accidentals on any noteheads that were hidden.\n4. Aligns the staccato dots in a straight line path. (The path may not be exactly straight\nif the articulation is set to avoid staff lines.)\n5. Adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes, if one does not already exist.\nIf you have entered parallel chords, it adds a gliss mark for each note in the chord.\n\nBy default, the script does not hide the last selected note (or any accidentals it may have). You can override\nthis behavior with a configuration file or if you are using RGP Lua 0.59 or higher, you can cause the script\nto hide the last note by holding down Shift, Option (Mac), or Alt (Win) when you invoke it.\n\nTo use a configuration file:\n\n1. If it does not exist, create a subfolder called `script_settings` in the folder where this script resides.\n2. Create a text file in the `script_settings` folder called `note_automatic_jete.config.txt`.\n3. Add either or both of the following lines to it.\n\n```\ndot_character = 46           -- This may be any character code you wish to search use, including a SMuFL character code.\nhide_last_note = true        -- This value will be reversed if you hold down a modifier key when invoking the script.

Presets for various raster sizes can be selected from the popup menu. A brief description of each raster size pops up when it is selected, paraphrased from the MOLA guidelines on parts and scores, Elaine Gould's \"Behind Bars\", and Steven Powell's \"Music Engraving Today: The Art and Practice of Digital Notesetting.\"\n\nSystem margins can use different units than page units. The default unit for system related measurements are spaces, but the plug-in will remember what was last used.\n\nYou can set or scale the staff spacing as you reformat, without the need to 'Respace Staves' using the Staff Tool. This can be useful for doing things like reformatting a tabloid sized score to A3 where slight adjustments to staff spacing might need to be made. Note that if you scale the staff spacing by a percentage, the dialog will be reset to 100% so that you don't keep applying the same transformation over and over. Systems can be locked or unlocked through the plug-in as needed before reformatting.\n\nIn addition to formatting the score and parts, you can set up \"special parts\" to have alternate formatting. This makes it easy to do something like create something like a Piano/Vocal score that may have different requirements than both the full score and the regular instrumental parts. The \"special parts\" feature could also be used to reformat a subset of parts without touching the others simply by diabling the 'Score' and 'Default Parts' sections of the plug-in.","requireScore":false,"categories":[],"minJWLuaVersion":"0.70","maxFinaleVersion":"","fileName":"page_format_wizard.lua"},{"undoText":"Pitch Changer","scriptGroupName":"Pitch Changer","id":"","requireSelection":true,"date":"2023-11-04","scriptGroupDescription":"Change all notes of one pitch in the region to another pitch","shortDescription":"Change all notes of one pitch in the region to another pitch","version":"v0.19","name":"Pitch Changer","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","author":{"website":"https://carlvine.com/lua/","name":"Carl Vine","email":""},"minJWLuaVersion":"0.64","noStore":false,"minFinaleVersion":"","maxFinaleVersion":"","menuItems":["Pitch Changer Repeat","Pitch Changer..."],"revisionNotes":[],"notes":"This script was inspired by Jari Williamsson's \"JW Change Pitches\" \nplug-in (2017) revived to work on Macs with non-Intel processors.\n\nIdentify \"from\" and \"to\" pitches by note name (a-g or A-G) \nfollowed by accidental (#-###, b-bbb) as required. \nMatching pitches will be changed in every octave. \nTo repeat the last pitch change without a confirmation dialog use \nthe \"Pitch Changer Repeat\" menu or hold down the SHIFT key at startup.\n\nKEY REPLACEMENTS:\n\nType \"z\", \"x\" or \"v\" to change the DIRECTION to \"Closest\", \n\"Up\" or \"Down\" respectively. \nType \"s\" as an alternative to \"#\". \nType \"w\" to swap the values in the \"From:\" and \"To:\" fields. \nType \"q\" to display this \"Information\" window.","categories":[],"requireScore":false,"maxJWLuaVersion":"","fileName":"pitch_changer.lua"},{"minJWLuaVersion":"0.67","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","scriptGroupDescription":"","minFinaleVersion":"","notes":"Change up to four specific pitches to other specific pitches. \nPitch specification is exact and immutable:\n\nFirst character: pitch name A-G. \n(Lower case will be replaced automatically with upper case)\n\nLast character: octave number 0-9.\n\nIn between: accidentals if needed. \nb / bb / bbb / # / ## / ### \n(you can use \"s\" instead of \"#\" - automatic replacement)\n\nIf you make a mistake with the pitch format you will be asked to \n\"FIX\" the mistake before the pitch change can take place. \n\"C4\" is middle C. \"B4\" is a major seventh above that.","scriptGroupName":"","categories":["Entries","Pitch","Transposition"],"date":"2024-01-24","maxFinaleVersion":"","requireScore":false,"undoText":"Pitch Singles Changer","revisionNotes":[],"name":"Pitch Singles Changer...","shortDescription":"Change up to four specific pitches to other specific pitches","author":{"email":"","website":"https://carlvine.com/lua/","name":"Carl Vine"},"noStore":false,"requireSelection":false,"maxJWLuaVersion":"","id":"","version":"0.07","menuItems":["Pitch Singles Changer..."],"fileName":"pitch_singles_changer.lua"},{"name":"Pitch: Chord Notes Keep-Delete...","revisionNotes":[],"categories":["Pitch","Transposition"],"version":"1.34","author":{"website":"","name":"Jacob Winkler, Nick Mazuk & Carl Vine","email":"jacob.winkler@mac.com"},"scriptGroupName":"","scriptGroupDescription":"","minJWLuaVersion":"0.70","notes":"Select a note within each chord to either keep or delete, \nnumbered from either the top or bottom of each chord. \n\n- __1__ deletes (or keeps) the top (or bottom) note \n- __2__ deletes (or keeps) the 2nd note from the top (or bottom) \n- etc. ...\n\n> If __Note Number__ or __Layer__ are highlighted  \n> then these __Key Commands__ are available:\n\n> - __z__: toggle keep/delete \n> - __x__: toggle top/bottom \n> - __m__: toggle \"Modeless\"\n> - __q__: show these notes \n> - __1-9__: note number \n> - __0-4__: layer number \n> - (delete key not needed for number entry) \n\nSelect __Modeless__ if you prefer the dialog window to \n\"float\" above your score and you can change the score selection \nwhile it's active.
