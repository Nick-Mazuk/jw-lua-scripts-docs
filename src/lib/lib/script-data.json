These mimic examples shown on p. 404 of “Behind Bars\"\nby Elaine Gould. For the best results with staccato dots, use an articulation with “Avoid Staff Lines” unchecked.\n\nBy default, the script searches for articulations using the '.' character (ASCII code 46) for non-SMuFL fonts and\nthe SMuFL dot character (UTF code 0xe4a2) for SMuFL fonts. This character must be the Main Character in Finale's\narticulation definition dialog. You can override this to search for a different character code using a\nconfiguration file. (See below.)\n\nTo use the script, you enter the notes you want to display, and it removes the noteheads in between the first\nand last notehead, adjusts any staccato dots, and adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes,\nunless there is one already there. If you want a slur as well, add it manually before or after running the script.\n\nThe steps to use this script are:\n\n1. Add the notes you want to display, with or without accidentals. Normally you choose notes with noteheads\nthat follow a straight-line path as closely as possible. They can be reduced size or grace notes.\n2. Add staccato dots if you want them.\n3. Add a slur if you want it.\n4. Run the script on the pattern you just entered.\n\nThe script takes the following actions:\n\n1. Searches for a selected pattern, skipping rests at the beginning and stopping at the first rest it encounters.\n2. Hides the noteheads on all but the first and (optionally) last entry.\n3. Hides accidentals on any noteheads that were hidden.\n4. Aligns the staccato dots in a straight line path. (The path may not be exactly straight\nif the articulation is set to avoid staff lines.)\n5. Adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes, if one does not already exist.\nIf you have entered parallel chords, it adds a gliss mark for each note in the chord.\n\nBy default, the script does not hide the last selected note (or any accidentals it may have). You can override\nthis behavior with a configuration file or if you are using RGP Lua 0.59 or higher, you can cause the script\nto hide the last note by holding down Shift, Option (Mac), or Alt (Win) when you invoke it.\n\nTo use a configuration file:\n\n1. If it does not exist, create a subfolder called `script_settings` in the folder where this script resides.\n2. Create a text file in the `script_settings` folder called `note_automatic_jete.config.txt`.\n3. Add either or both of the following lines to it.\n\n```\ndot_character = 46           -- This may be any character code you wish to search use, including a SMuFL character code.\nhide_last_note = true        -- This value will be reversed if you hold down a modifier key when invoking the script. (See above.)\n```","revisionNotes":[],"id":""},{"name":"Autoposition Rolled Chord Articulations","fileName":"articulation_autoposition_rolled_chords.lua","undoText":"Autoposition Rolled Chord Articulations","shortDescription":"Copy Main Symbol Vertically","requireSelection":true,"requireScore":false,"noStore":false,"author":{"name":"Robert Patterson","website":"","email":""},"copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","version":"1.0","categories":["Articulation"],"date":"2021-12-26","notes":"How to use this script:\n\n1.

Run the script.\n\nThe script searches for any articulations with the \"Copy Main Symbol Vertically\" option checked.\nIt automatically positions them to the left of any accidentals and changes their length so that they align\nwith the top and bottom of the chord with a slight extension. (Approximately 1/4 space on either end.\nIt may be longer depending on the length of the character defined for the articulation.)\n\nIf you are working with a keyboard or other multi-staff instrument, the script automatically extends the top\narticulation across any staff or staves below, provided the lower staves also have the same articulation mark.\nIt then hides the lower mark(s). This behavior is limited to staves that are selected. To suppress this behavior\nand restrict positioning to single staves, hold down Shift, Option (macOS), or Alt (Windows) key when invoking\nthe script.\n\nThis script requires RGP Lua 0.59 or later.","revisionNotes":[],"id":""},{"name":"Bariolage","fileName":"note_bariolage.lua","undoText":"Bariolage","shortDescription":"Bariolage: Creates alternating layer pattern from layer 1.

It supports composite numerators allowing meters like (3+2+3/16) in conjunction with further composites (e.g. (3+2+3/16)+(1/4)+(5+4/8)). Alternate \"display\" time signatures can be equally complex. At startup the script shows the time signature of the first selected measure. Click the \"Clear All\" button to revert to a simple 4/4 with no other options.

If one measure is selected only it will be affected.

Multiples of 3 will automatically convert to compound signatures so, for instance, (9/16) will convert to three groups of dotted 8ths. To suppress automatic compounding, instead of the bottom 'note' number enter its EDU equivalent (quarter note = 1024; eighth note = 512 etc) but be careful since Finale can get confused if the number is inappropriate.\n\nEmpty and zero \"Top\" numbers are ignored.
