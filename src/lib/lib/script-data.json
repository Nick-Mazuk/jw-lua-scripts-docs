These mimic examples shown on p. 404 of “Behind Bars\"\nby Elaine Gould. For the best results with staccato dots, use an articulation with “Avoid Staff Lines” unchecked.\n\nBy default, the script searches for articulations using the '.' character (ASCII code 46) for non-SMuFL fonts and\nthe SMuFL dot character (UTF code 0xe4a2) for SMuFL fonts. This character must be the Main Character in Finale's\narticulation definition dialog. You can override this to search for a different character code using a\nconfiguration file. (See below.)\n\nTo use the script, you enter the notes you want to display, and it removes the noteheads in between the first\nand last notehead, adjusts any staccato dots, and adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes,\nunless there is one already there. If you want a slur as well, add it manually before or after running the script.\n\nThe steps to use this script are:\n\n1. Add the notes you want to display, with or without accidentals. Normally you choose notes with noteheads\nthat follow a straight-line path as closely as possible. They can be reduced size or grace notes.\n2. Add staccato dots if you want them.\n3. Add a slur if you want it.\n4. Run the script on the pattern you just entered.\n\nThe script takes the following actions:\n\n1. Searches for a selected pattern, skipping rests at the beginning and stopping at the first rest it encounters.\n2. Hides the noteheads on all but the first and (optionally) last entry.\n3. Hides accidentals on any noteheads that were hidden.\n4. Aligns the staccato dots in a straight line path. (The path may not be exactly straight\nif the articulation is set to avoid staff lines.)\n5. Adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes, if one does not already exist.\nIf you have entered parallel chords, it adds a gliss mark for each note in the chord.\n\nBy default, the script does not hide the last selected note (or any accidentals it may have). You can override\nthis behavior with a configuration file or if you are using RGP Lua 0.59 or higher, you can cause the script\nto hide the last note by holding down Shift, Option (Mac), or Alt (Win) when you invoke it.\n\nTo use a configuration file:\n\n1. If it does not exist, create a subfolder called `script_settings` in the folder where this script resides.\n2. Create a text file in the `script_settings` folder called `note_automatic_jete.config.txt`.\n3. Add either or both of the following lines to it.\n\n```\ndot_character = 46           -- This may be any character code you wish to search use, including a SMuFL character code.\nhide_last_note = true        -- This value will be reversed if you hold down a modifier key when invoking the script.

Allows view, modify, create, and delete.","notes":"This script provides a simplified interface for managing the most common types\nof custom key modes (called \"Nonstandard Key Signatures\" in Finale.) Limitations include\n\n- Key modes must have 7 diatonic steps per octave\n- Linear key signatures must use the standard accidental order and size (for their EDO value)\n- Linear tonal centers must follow the standard circle of fifths for their respective key signatures\n\nThe dialog has the following main components:\n\n- **List of Keymodes [Delete] [Delete All]**: Shows any currently existing custom key modes in the document, with buttons to delete the current or all of them.\n- **MIDI Note for Middle C**: The MIDI note that plays back for the note written one ledger line below the treble clef.\n- **Base Tonal Center**: For linear modes, the note that is the tonal center when there is no key signature. For nonlinear modes, the note that is the tonal center.\n- **Linear/Nonlinear**: Linear modes can be transposed into the full array of key signatures. Nonlinear modes only ever have the specified key signature.\n- **Accidental Font**: The font that is used for accidentals.\n- **Accidental Symbols**: Opens a dialog that allows you to specify strings for up to 7 flat steps and 7 sharp steps plus a natural symbol. These strings can have more than one symbol. If no accidentals have been set up, the dialog is populated with the default characters specified in the document settings.\n\n---\n\n- **Diatonic Step Map**: Specifies the number of divisions of the octave between each white note on the keyboard. Before any custom key modes are created in the document, this is initialized with the common practice 12-EDO values. Note that the diatonic step map _always_ starts with C, irrespective of which note is the base tonal center.\n- **EDO Presets Pulldown**: This pulldown provides a shortcut for populating the diatonic step map for commonly used EDO values.\n\n---\n\n- **[Linear Key Modes] Accidental Step Amount (Chromatic Halfstep Size)**: This the step amount for each accidental in the key signature as you step into more sharps or more flats in the key signature. To get common practice key signatures, set it to the number of divisions of the octave in a chromatic half-step. (The **EDO Presets Pulldown** sets this value automatically for linear key modes.)\n- **[Nonlinear Key Modes] Accidental Order [note][amount]**: The seven pairs of edit fields allow you to specify the accidentals in the nonlinear key signature in any arbitrary order with any mix of sharps of flats. The first amount value of 0 or blank terminates the key signature.\n- **Accidental Octaves**: Opens a grid of values by clef types. Each value specifies the octave in which the accidental in that slot appears for that clef. Linear key modes using common practice key signatures generally do not need to specify anything here. Nonlinear key modes almost certainly _will_ need to specify these values.\n- **Revert**: Reverts the accidental octaves to their default values.","noStore":false,"requireScore":false,"minFinaleVersion":"","name":"Nonstandard Key Signatures...","minJWLuaVersion":"0.72","scriptGroupDescription":"","fileName":"key_modes_manage.lua"},{"revisionNotes":["Edited by Nick Mazuk to give more detailed duration statistics"],"id":"","shortDescription":"Counts the number of each note value in a given region","categories":["Note"],"maxJWLuaVersion":"","scriptGroupDescription":"","requireSelection":false,"menuItems":["Note Duration Statistics"],"noStore":false,"name":"Note Duration Statistics","undoText":"Note Duration Statistics","notes":"","maxFinaleVersion":"","date":"2020-06-26","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","version":"1.0.1","author":{"name":"Jari Williamsson","website":"","email":""},"scriptGroupName":"","minJWLuaVersion":"","requireScore":false,"minFinaleVersion":"","fileName":"note_duration_statistics.lua"},{"scriptGroupDescription":"","author":{"email":"","website":"","name":"Jacob Winkler"},"undoText":"Note Filter","date":"2024-01-27","categories":[],"menuItems":["Note Filter..."],"revisionNotes":[],"requireScore":false,"requireSelection":true,"noStore":false,"notes":"","maxFinaleVersion":"","minJWLuaVersion":"","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","minFinaleVersion":"","shortDescription":"Deletes notes above or below a specified note","name":"Note Filter...","id":"","maxJWLuaVersion":"","version":"1.0","scriptGroupName":"","fileName":"pitch_filter.lua"},{"id":"","author":{"name":"Carl Vine","website":"https://carlvine.com/lua/","email":""},"copyright":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","shortDescription":"Change notehead shapes on a specific layer of the current selection","minFinaleVersion":"","date":"2023-11-30","revisionNotes":[],"scriptGroupName":"Noteheads Change by Layer","scriptGroupDescription":"Change notehead shapes on a specific layer of the current selection","menuItems":["Noteheads Change Repeat","Noteheads Change by Layer..."],"noStore":false,"notes":"Change notehead shapes on a specific layer of the current \nselection to one of these options:  \nCircled | Default | Diamond | Guitar Diamond |  \nHidden | Number | Round | Slash | Square |  \nStrikethrough | Triangle | Wedge | X |  \n\nThis script produces an ordered list of notehead types, \neach line beginning with a configurable \"hotkey\". \nCall the script, type the hotkey and hit [enter] or [return].  \n\nIn SMuFL fonts like Finale Maestro, shapes can vary according \nto duration values.

One hopes, for example,\nthat if there were a printed score that were out of date, this tool would flag the minimum number of changes that needed to\nbe hand-corrected in the older score.","minFinaleVersion":"","requireSelection":false,"minJWLuaVersion":"0.63","maxJWLuaVersion":"","id":"","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","shortDescription":"Write current document to text file.","scriptGroupName":"","fileName":"document_save_as_text.lua"},{"menuItems":["Import Document Options from JSON...","Save Document Options as JSON..."],"categories":["Report"],"name":"Save Document Options as JSON...","maxJWLuaVersion":"","date":"2024-02-05","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","scriptGroupName":"","revisionNotes":["v2.1.4      Switch to cjson","v2.1.3      Luacheck hinting","v2.1.2      Resync expression definitions","v2.1.1      Add music spacing allotments (requires RGPLua v0.66)","v2.0.1      Add ability to import","v1.2.1      Add Grid/Guide snap-tos; better organization of SmartShapes","v1.1.2      First public release"],"noStore":false,"undoText":"","requireScore":false,"maxFinaleVersion":"","id":"9c05a4c4-9508-4608-bb1b-2819cba96101","notes":"While other plugins exist that let you copy document options directly from one document to another, \nthis script saves the options from the current document in an organized human-readable form, as a \nJSON file.
