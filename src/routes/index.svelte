A central repository for all JW Lua scripts for Finale. These guidelines are suggestions for now until we agree on some way to standardize and organize things.

## Adding Scripts

Just create a pull request. All scripts must have in their [PluginDef](http://jwmusic.nu/jwplugins/wiki/doku.php?id=jwlua:development#connect_to_finale_jw_lua):

- finaleplugin.Author
- finaleplugin.Version (beta versions OK)
- finaleplugin.RevisionNotes (if there are revisions and/or bug fixes)
- Name, undo text, and description (in the \`return\` statement)

Note: All scripts added to the repo will have a CC1 license. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/Nick-Mazuk/jw-lua-scripts/blob/master/LICENSE) for specific terms. This is to encourage widespread use and encourage other JW Lua coders to build off your scripts.

### Naming scripts

Let's follow a unified syntax to help organize everything. Use snake case:

\`\`\`
✓ articulation_delete_from_rests.lua

✖ articulationDeleteFromRests.lua

✖ articulationdeletefromrests.lua

✖ articulation-delete-from-rests.lua

✖ articulation_Delete_From_Rests.lua
\`\`\`

Each word should take things from general to specific. So anything dealing with articulations should start with "articulations". Anything with page layout should start with "layout". See the [JW Lua docs for Category Tags](http://jwmusic.nu/jwplugins/wiki/doku.php?id=jwlua:finaleplugin_properties#categorytags_string) to find an good starting place.

### Style Guide

Though not strictly necessary, try to follow the [style guide](https://github.com/Nick-Mazuk/jw-lua-scripts/blob/master/Style%20Guide.md). That way, we can all edit and read each other's code easily.

### Using the Standard Library

The standard library is a set of pre-made Lua functions you can use in your code. Functions are grouped into modules to speed up run-time and for quicker development.

\`\`\`lua
-- use once at top of script file, tells JW Lua where the library modules are saved
-- These first few lines will eventually be phased out
local path = finale.FCString()
path:SetRunningLuaFolderPath()
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. path.LuaString .. "?.lua"

-- load each library module you'll use
local library = require("library.file_name") -- no path, no ".lua"

-- run a library function
library.function_name()
\`\`\`

If you wish to contribute to the standard library, create a pull request.

## Submit a bug, feature request, or script request

[Please submit an issue to keep things organized](https://github.com/Nick-Mazuk/jw-lua-scripts/issues/new/choose).

## Resources

If you are new to JW Lua, visit the [JW Lua start page](http://jwmusic.nu/jwplugins/wiki/doku.php?id=jw_lua). Of particular interest is the [Script Programming in JW Lua](http://jwmusic.nu/jwplugins/wiki/doku.php?id=jwlua:development) page, which describes built-in namespaces and variables that connect Lua to the [Finale PDK Framework](http://www.finaletips.nu/frameworkref/).

An early version of the C++ source code of the PDK Framework is available for [download here](http://finaletips.nu/index.php/download/category/21-plug-in-development). Unfortunately Makemusic has ceased permitting new developers to access the PDK, so building the PDK Framework does not serve much purpose without it. However, the source code may be useful as a reference for understanding how to use the Framework. (Much of the current source code is viewable in the PDK Framework documentation.)

Frequently when working with Finale, it is useful to discover which data structures the Finale program itself modifies when you make a change through the user interface. To that end there is a free Finale plugin that writes your document out to a simple text file.

The plugin's normal use case is to create a small file that illustrates what you are working on. Dump it to text before changing it with Finale and again after changing it. Then compare the two using any number of free text file comparison utilities. A common one is \`\`\`kDiff3\`\`\`, which is available for Windows and macOS. (Links change, so the easiest way to find the current version is a search engine.) The plugin includes both the internal data structure and the corresponding PDK Framework class name if there is one.

You can [download it here](http://robertgpatterson.com/-fininfo/-downloads/download-free.html). Also available on the page is a free plugin to reorganize the script menu for JW Lua. See the page for more details. The sample file linked there arranges the scripts in this GitHub repository into a series of submenus.
