## has_mixin

\`\`\`lua
fluid_mixins.has_mixin(name)
\`\`\`

Object Method: Checks if the object it is called on has a mixin applied.

| --- | --- | --- |
| \`name\` | \`string\` | Mixin name. |

| Output type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \`boolean\` |  |

## has_mixin

\`\`\`lua

\`\`\`

Object Method: Applies a mixin to the object it is called on.


| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`name\` | \`string\` | Mixin name. |

## register_global_mixin

\`\`\`lua
fluid_mixins.register_global_mixin(class, prop[, value])
\`\`\`

Library Method: Register a mixin for a finale class that will be applied globally (ie to all instances of the specified classes, including existing instances). Properties and methods cannot end in an underscore.


| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`class\` | \`string\|array\` | The target class (or an array of classes). |
| \`prop\` | \`string\|table\` | Either the property name, or a table with pairs of (string) = (mixed) |
@ value [mixed] OPTIONAL: Method or property value. Will be ignored if prop is a table.

## register_mixin

\`\`\`lua
fluid_mixins.register_mixin(class, mixin_name, prop[, value])
\`\`\`

Library Method: Register a named mixin which can then be applied by calling the target object's apply_mixin method. If a named mixin requires a 'constructor', include a method called 'init' that accepts zero arguments. It will be called when the mixin is applied. Properties and methods cannot end in an underscore.

fluid_mixins.get_global_mixin(class, prop)
\`\`\`

Library Method: Returns a copy of all methods and properties of a global mixin.


| Input | Type | Description |
